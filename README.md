Finished solving 50 Project Euler problems!!! (http://projecteuler.net/problems) (5/6/2014) Only 6.97%, 30273 out of 434277 software people worldwide, have done this.

Graph algorithms (see my 900 lines of code, with full RSpec tests): https://github.com/rayning0/ProjectEuler-and-Algorithms/tree/master/graph_algorithms  
RSpec output: https://github.com/rayning0/ProjectEuler-and-Algorithms/blob/master/graph_algorithms/data/rspec_screen_output.txt

CodeEval (https://www.codeeval.com/open_challenges/), and algorithm problems. See /euler, /codeeval, and /algo directories. Please do NOT see my solution for a problem unless you have first tried it yourself.
